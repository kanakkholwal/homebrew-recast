# Homebrew Cask formula for Recast.
#
# This file is the template; `scripts/release/update-homebrew-cask.sh`
# substitutes 0.3.1 / 3d725d25f29ebf8b57e7c5c5dc2e9a17ccd8f46b15cf75c0824f4a48ba4cfb0c / 67f95116d09d310fb681f9fce2aa8d6ddf8eec6b415c49b39a3923b5dd125fb4 on each release
# and pushes the rendered file to `kanakkholwal/homebrew-recast` as
# `Casks/recast.rb`. End users then install with
#
#     brew install --cask kanakkholwal/recast/recast
#
# or — after a one-time `brew tap kanakkholwal/recast` — with the short
#
#     brew install --cask recast
#
# Homebrew strips the macOS quarantine attribute automatically during
# its install, so users on this path never see the Gatekeeper
# "is damaged" error and don't need the `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`
# workaround documented for direct-DMG downloads.
